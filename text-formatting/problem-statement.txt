Write a program that takes a text file as input and prints its contents to standard output in a
‘properly formatted’ manner. See below for more details about formatting requirements.
Input format: Your program should take a single command line argument that specifies the name
of the input file. The input file will contain one or more paragraphs of text. Paragraphs will be
separated by one or more blank lines. You may assume that the text will contain only letters, digits,
punctuation marks (comma, semi-colon, colon, fullstop, question mark, exclamation mark, but no
dashes, hyphens, parentheses) and white space.

Output format specifications:
• Words should be separated by one or more blanks.
• There should be no whitespace between a word and a following punctuation mark, but each
punctuation mark should be followed by one or more blanks.
• Paragraphs should be separated by exactly one blank line.
• Each line of each paragraph should start with and end in a non-whitespace character.
• The paragraphs should appear ‘fully justified’, i.e., all lines except the last line of each paragraph
should be exactly 80 characters long. It will usually be necessary to add extra blank spaces in
between words to achieve this effect. For a ‘natural’ look, the number of extra blanks inserted
around a word should roughly be proportional to the length of the word.
• No word should be split across lines.
• If a single word is longer than 80 characters, it should appear by itself on one line.
• You should minimise the total number of lines required in the output, i.e., each line should
contain the maximum number of non-whitespace characters possible, subject to the constraints
given above.
