Generate a random undirected graph with at least 100 nodes. Vary the edge probability between a pair of vertices so that the graph is reasonably sparse. Now apply the algorithm for computing the biconnected components to mark each edge with its biconnected component number in O(n+m) time, where n and m are the number of vertices and edges of the graph respectively.
